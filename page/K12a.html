      <p><h3>START-UP GRANTS for Foreign Studies Application</h3></p>
	  <p>It aims to assist HEI Faculty and Staff who wishes to pursue further studies abroad but hindered by the costs of required examinations such as GRE, TOEFL, and/or IELTS. Qualified recipients shall be awarded vouchers to cover costs of the exams.</p>
	  
	  <p><h3>PH.D SANDWICH PROGRAM</h3></p>
	  <p>Scholars who have completed all required coursework in a Philippine higher education institution (home HEI) may conduct a maximum of one (1) year dissertation research in host HEI abroad, and return to the home HEI to complete dissertation writing.</p>
   

	  <p><h3>PARTIAL SUPPORT For Masters's and Doctoral Studies Abroad</h3></p>
	  <p>The Commission realizes the fact that there are highly commendable aspiring applicants from HEIs but constrained by the insufficiency of funds for pursuing further education abroad. Thus, the grant aim to give support for the applicants such as tuition fees, lodging and other expenses.</p>

	  <p><h3>FULL SUPPORT For Master's and Doctoral Studies Abroad</h3></p>
	  <p>In pursuit of the goal to send our best scholars abroad, CHED has been in talks with a wide range of partners with the goal of providing partial support for deserving Filipino scholars, exploring in the process the possibility of obtaining supplementary funds or even full scholarships from their respective networks abroad. These potential partners have a long history and strong track record of placing scholars in high quality institutions abroad for graduate studies, both within the ASEAN region and in their respective countries.</p>
