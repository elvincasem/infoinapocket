				 <p>The Commission on Higher Education (CHED)  was created on May 18, 1994 through the passage of Republic Act No. 7722, or the Higher Education Act of 1994. CHED, an attached agency to the Office of the President for administrative purposes, is headed by a chairman and four commissioners, each having a term of office of four years. The Commission En Banc  acts as a collegial body in formulating plans, policies and strategies relating to higher education and the operation of CHED.
				<p>The creation of CHED was part of a broad agenda of reforms on the country’s education system outlined by the Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) in 1992. Part of the reforms was the trifocalization of the education sector into three governing bodies: the CHED for tertiary and graduate education, the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic education and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical-vocational and middle-level education.</p>

              <p><h2>INVESTING THE FUTURE OF PHILIPPINE HIGHER EDUCATION</h2></p>
			  <P>It is a season of unprecendented change for Philippine education, shaped by aggressive reform measures from within, with the full implementation of the new K to 12 system in 2016, and rapidly advancing movements from without, as it joins the ASEAN Economic Community.</P>
			  
			  <p>The five year period between 2016 and 2021, referred to as the K to 12 Transition Period, the multi-year low enrolment in our colleges and universities, presents significant challenges but al one-in-a-generation opportunities to invest significantly in strengthening Philippine higher education.</p>
			  
			  <p>Through the K to 12 Transition Program of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Philippine government is making an unprecendented commitment towards (1) increasing the relevance and quality of education for Filipinos, (2) enhancing competitiveness of Philippine colleges, universities and faculty, while (3) mitigating the impact of multi-year low enrolment on the high education sector.</p>
			  
			  <a href="#"><h3>MID-WAY THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION (BY 2018):</h3></a>
			  
			  <p>HEIs with full readiness to offer the Revised General Education curriculum, and the updated and outcomes-based college curriculum beginning june 2018 (for the batch of Senior High School graduates)</p>
			  <p>Enhanced academic leadership and management of public and private colleges and universities</p>
			  <p>Improvements in the quality and impact of research</p>
			  
			  <a href="#"><h3>BY END OF THE K TO 12 TRANSITION (2021):</h3></a>
			  
			  <p>70% of faculty with relevant graduate degrees</p>
			  <p>Increased number of faculty with exposure to industry best practice, thereby ensuring relevance and work-readiness of college education</p>
			  <p>HEIs that are regionally and globally competitive</p>
			  <p>Increased productivity of HEIs in terms of research and publication</p>
			  <p>Strengthend role of HEIs in supporting regional and national development goals through extension work and technology generation</p>
